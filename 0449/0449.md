Some stuff about positional numbers, just more number stuff we know this comeon son.
Also some stuff about overflow.

Need to know:
- When signed numbers are not negative
- Convert 2's complement encoding and decimal
- Interpret base-16 as base-2

The range of an unsigned integer is 0 to $2^n-1$
The range of a 2's complement number is $-2^{n-1}$ to $2^{n-1}-1$

Java types:
- byte 8bits
- short 16bits
- int 32bits
- long 64bits

C types:
(can be signed or unsigned, 2's complement the default)
- char usig char 8bits
- short int usig short int 16bits
- int usig int 32bit
- long int usig long int 64 bits

Sizes of integers are usually based on the underlying architecture
C provides standard library constants defining the ranges

`sizeof` - obtain the byte size of data
`sizeof` is an operator, like + or -

Integer casting
- Explicit conversion between signed and unsigned:
```
int sx, sy;
unsigned ux, uy;
sx = (int) ux;
uy = (unsigned) sy;
```
- *Maybe* a problem, if the unsigned number is too large to fit into the signed
- C will let you move a value from unsigned to signed  integer, however this is
**not** always valid.
- Moving values between types is called casting
- Implicit casting is possible, which can be dangerous
- By default all intger constants are considered signed integers
    - Can use "u" suffic to explicitly force unsigned: `12u`
- When you mixed unsigned and signed in a single expression, signed values
are implicitily cast to unsigned, including operators like `<.>,==,<=,>=`

Floating point in C
- C guarantees two lefts, float (single precision) and double (double precision)
- Casting between int, float, and double changes bit representation
- double/float $\rightarrow$ int
    - Truncates fractional part
    - Like rounding towards zero
    - Not defined when out of range
- int $\rightarrow$ double
    - Exact conversion, as long as int has â‰¤ 53 bit word size
- int $\rightarrow$ float
    - Will round according to rounding mode

C programming language
- Procedural language
- Functional
- gcc hello.c to compile
- ./a.out loads and executes program
- Manaul(malloc, free) storage
- Comments: //
- Constants: #define, const
- Preprocessor
- naming convention is _ between words
- #include <stdio.h> library access

Hello world example:
```
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
    printf("Hello World\n");
    return 0;
}
```
