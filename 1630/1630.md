Classics is the study of ancient Greece and Rome (ancient Mediterranean)
Sets up a hierarchy with Greek and Rome culture at the top of exemplary.
Basically we put these ancient cultures on a pedistal, making us believe they
were so great and perfect. Are they?
One reason that we value Greece so much in particular is the democracy they had.
These cultures had a lot of power, and believed they were a superier race.
Exceptionalism happens with a lot of these societies, and some today, once they
get big and powerful people beleive they are the best, and shit gets weird.
