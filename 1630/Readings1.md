#### Painter 2010 introductions
Attempted to racialize antiquity, or make ancient "calssic" times intor a 
protait of white people doing great things, emphazised by the classic marble
white statue.
Today we think of race as biology, although are easily reminded that the meaning
behind race and its history is not just physical.
- Labor, gender, class
It is wrong to assume that slavery anywhere must rest of race.
- Similar logic to what most of us attribute slavery in America to has been
applied to white people. Specifically when those people were impoverished 
immigrants.
Always, those at the bottom were slaves
- Most not equate whiteness to freedom and blackness to slavery, however it is
often forgotten that white slavery in Europe also played a role in the mixed
genes today.

This is basically saying that while the most thought of form of slavery is the 
more recent slavery in America, with race playing a huge part, really the only 
part that we look at. However slavery has been around in the world for a very long
time, and the white race has also been enslaved. More than just race, those on 
the bottom of the economic pyramid are always the ones being enslaved, but this
is always just one race? idek

Cuacasion refers to the concepts of beauty related to the white slaves trade in 
Europe.
- Whiteness remains thought of as the beauty found in art history and popular 
culture.
Whiteness as "radically indivisible, though ethnically divided"
Biologists today dont believe in the physical existance of race, however still
recognize the problem of racism wont soon end.

Johann Touchim Winckelmann is considered to be the father of art history.
- Contributed greatly to the image of the ideal color and form of a human.
- His ideal being that of Greek gods, resting on the respect for the Renaissance.

Winckelmann idealised the ancient Greek culture greatly, and his work was widely
accepted and looked up too. While he did not create this idealism for ancient Greece,
his work did a lot to progress that beleive of their greatness.

Because Winckelmann was not actually in Greece, but in Rome, he mostly had access
to copies of ancient Greek art.
While actual Greek statues are made with a different marble than in Italy, making
their statues darker, Roman statues were pearly white, misleading Winckelmanns
ideaology.
Winckelmann also wrongly assumed that Greek's were too sophisicated to color their
art.
Once the ancient "classics" were being studied more, the art from these times was
being copied, however not from originals, but from Winckelmanns findings in the copies
Romans made of Greek art.
Original artifacts that were found with this darker look were assumed to be aged,
and attempted "cleaning" of them was tried, but later halted due to damage.

Petras Camper rose in academia, using vertical and horizontal lines across the
front of the human face in order to distingues between race. 
Camper's intent was to show, though numerical findings, that the human races
were not so different, believing in human unity.
However the reception of his findings was not what he had meant them to be.
His chart put the skull of black people next to those of orangutans and chimpazee's,
while placing Euopeans next to that ideal of a Greek God.
Instead of the numeric findings Camper had, people focused on the positioning of 
the skulls.
Eventually Camper lost academic standing because of his simple facial angles
loosing credibility in Europe. However in America, during slavery there, this was
looked at as proof of white supremicy.

Johann Kasper Lavater believed that God created humans outsides to reflect their
inner selves, showing more beautiful people to be better on the inside.
- This further spread Winckelmanns work, but as with Camper, Lavaters ideas fell
out of popularity.
Polygenesis is the idea that all the differnt colored humans came from serperate
divine creation, White popularizing this idea.
- Relating economic growth and physical beauty.
