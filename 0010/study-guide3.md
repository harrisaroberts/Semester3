# Chapter 10: Development
## The stages of prenatal development (germinal, embryonic, fetal), Wolffian and Mullerian systems
Germinal: conception to 2 weeks
    - Zygote: a fertilized egg
Embryonic: 2-8 weeks
    - Gonadal development (around 6 weeks)
        - Wolffian system: leads to male reproductive organs
            - androgens promp the development of the Wolffian system and a Mullerian-inhibiting substance
        - Mullerian system: leads to femal reproductive organs
            - doesnt require a surge of hormones
    - Most sensitive phase for birth defects
    - Essential development phases
Fetal: 9 weeks to birth
    - Structual development
## Motor development: cephalocaudal rule and proximodistal rule
Cephalocaudal rule: from head to tail, from top to bottom
    Head - neck - other parts of body
Proximodistal rule: from center to peripheral
    Torso - arm/leg - finger/toe
## Infants and the looking time paradigm
Looking time paradigm: After habituation, infant look more at impossible events
than possible events
## Piaget and cognitive development. Definitions and examples of the developmental stages: sensorimotor stage, preoperational stage, concrete operational stage, and formal operational stage and the key components of the stages (assimilation and accommodation,
Cognitive development(Jean Piaget): the emergence of the ability to think and understand
    - How the physical world works
    - How their minds represent it
    - How other minds represent it
Schema: theories about or models of the way the world works
    - Assimilation: apply old schema to make sense of new cases
    - Accommodation: revise old schema according to new cases
Sensorimotor(0-2)
    - Infant experiences world though movement and senses, develops schemas, begins
    to act intentionally, and shows evidence of understanding object permanence
Preoperational(2-6)
    - Child acquires motor skills, but does not understand conservation of physical
    properties. Child begins this stage by thinking eqocentrically but ends with 
    a basic understanding of others minds.
Concrete operational(6-11)
    - Child can think logically abut physical objects and events and understand 
    conservation of physical properties
Formal operational(11+)
    - Child can think logically about abstract propostions and hypotheticals
## object permanence, egocentrism, conservation, and theory of mind: false belief task and how they relate to the developmental stages
Object permanence: Object continues to exist when out of sight
Egocentrism: Children have difficulty understanding perspective other than their own.
They assume that others see, think, and feel the same way they do.
Conservation: Quantitive properties of an object are invariant despite changes in the 
objects appearance
Theory of mind:
    - False belief task: Can someone else hold a belief thats incorrect & different
    form the child's own belief?
## Vygotsky: joint attention, social referencing, imitation
Joint attention: the ability to focus on what anbother person is focused on.
Social referencing: the ability to use another person's reactions as information
about the world - often when reacting to novel/ambiguos stimuli
Imitation: the ability to do what another person does.
## Attachment, Consequences of Attachment Styles, Styles of attachment (secure, avoidant, ambivalent and disorganized)
Secure(60%)
    - Parent behavior: sensitive & consistent
    - Child behavior: believes and trusts needs will be met.
Aviodant(15-20%)
    - Parent behavior: distant & disenganged
    - Child behavior: subconscious belief that needs wont be met
Ambivalent/anxious(9-15%)
    - Parent behavior: inconsisten; sensitive or neglectful
    - Child behavior: seeks reassurance, cannot rely on needs to be met
Disorganized(15%)
    - Parent behavior: extreme and erratic 
    - Child behavior: confused, lacks strategy to have needs met
Consequences of attachment: future social relationship, parenting, mental health
## Kohlberg’s stages of moral development (preconventional, conventional and postconventional): key aspects of each stage, definitions, and examples
Pre-conventional: Obedience & punishment; individualism & exchange
    - Ill get caught if I do this
    - If it geels good then...
Conventional: Interpersonal relationships; Authority & social order
    - It will please someone
    - I have to obey the rules
Post-conventional: Social contract; Universal principles
    - Its a consensus of society
    - There are principles above all
# Chapter 11: Personality
## The definition of personality
Individuals characteristic style of behaving, thinking and feelings
## Explanations of personality differences, prior and anticipated events
Explanations of personality differences are concerned with prior events and anticipated
events that effect personality.
## Ways to measure personality: self-report surveys, projective techniques (Rorschach Ink Blot and TAT), and objective ways to measure personality (EAR). The benefits and drawbacks to each measure type.
Self-report: a series of answers to a questionnaire that aks people to indicate the 
extent to which sets of statements of abjectives accurately describe their own 
behavior or mental state
Projective techniques: a standard series of ambiguos stimuli designed to elicit unique
responses that revel inner aspects of an individuals personality
    - Rorschach inkblot test: show people inkblots and see what the interpret it as
    - Thematic apperception test: interpretation/narrative of ambigious pictures 
    of people
Objective measures: EAR device
    - Measurements throughout the day
    - Avoids self-report & interpretation biases
## The Big Five (openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, neuroticism)
OCEAN
Openness
    - High: imaginative variety, independent
    - Low: down-to-earth routine, conforming
Conscientiousness
    - High: organized, careful, self-disciplined
    - Low: disorganized, careless, weak-willed
Extraversion
    - High: social, fun loving, affectionate
    - Low: retiring, sober, reserved
Agreeableness
    - High: softhearted, trusting, helpful
    - Low: ruthless, suspicious, uncooperative
Neuroticism
    - High: worried, insecure, self-pitying
    - Low: calm, secure, self-satisfied
## Freud: Id, Ego, and Superego
Id:
    - At birth
    - hedonic, driven by pleasure
Ego:
    - Age 1-2
    - Constraints of reality, balances id and super ego
Super-ego: 
    - Age 5-6
    - Social and moral ideal
# Chapter 12: Social Psychology
The study of the causes and consequences of sociality
## Aggression (Frustration-aggression hypothesis, gender: instrumental vs. relational)
Aggression: behavior whose purpose is to harm another
Frustration-aggression hypothesis: a principle stating that animals and people aggress
only when their goals are thwarted
Instrumental aggression: motivated by the desire to obtain a concrete goal, such as
gaining possession of a peer's toy. Physical fighting(boy-man)
Relational aggression: harms other by damaging their peer relationships(girl-woman)
## Cooperation: The Prisoner’s Dilemma (potential outcomes), The Ultimatum Game
Experiment involving two rational agents, each of whom can either cooperate for mutal
benifi or betrayt their partner for individual gain. The dilemma arises from the fact
that while defecting is rational for each agent, cooperation yields a higher payoff
for each.
## Groups: Prejudice and discrimination; deindividuation and diffusion of responsibility, effects of mob size
Group: a collection of people who have something in common that distinguishes them
from others
    - favoritism towards other members of the group
Prejudice: a positive or negative evaluation of another person based on their group
membership
Discrimination: positive or negative beavior towards another personal based on their
group membership

Decision making in groups can be hindered
Inclusion in groups promotes well-being and a feeling of belonging

deindividuation: when immersion in a group causes people to become less aware of 
their individual values
Diffusion of responsibility: the tendency for individuals to feel diminished responsibility
for their actions when they are surrounded by others who are acting the same way.
## The three basic motivations for controlling other people (Hedonic, approval and accuracy)
Social influence: the ability to control another persons behavior
    - There are three basic motivations which make people susceptible to social
    influence
        - The hedonic motive: people want to experience please
            - Rewards vs punishments
        - Approval motive: be accepted and avoid rejection
        - Accuracy motive: believe what is right, avoid what is wrong
## Normative influence, norm of reciprocity and door-in-the-face technique
Norm: a customary standard for behavior that is widely shared by members of a culture
Normative influence: occurs when another persons behavior provides information about
what is appropriate
Norm of reciprocity: the unwritten rule that people should benifit those who have
benifited them
Door-in-the-face technique: a strategy that uses reciprocating concession to influence
behavior
## Conformity (Asch) and Obedience (Milgram) – what was crucial in Milgram’s experiment and what did the outcome of these studies demonstrate
Conformity: the tendency to do what others do simply because others are doing it
Obedience: the tendency to do what powerful people tell us to do
    - Stanley Milgrams obedience study
    - Philip Zambardo's prison experiment
## Informational influence, Attitude vs. belief
Informational influence: occurs when another persons behavior provides information
about what is good or right
Attitudes tell us what we should do, beliefs tell us how to do it.
    - Attitude: an enduring positive or negative evaluation of an object of event
    - Belief: an enduring piece of knowledge about an object or event
## Systematic and Heuristic persuasion
Persuasion: a persons attitudes or beliefs are influenced by a communication from
another person
Systematic: the process by which attitudes, or beliefs are changed by appeals to 
reason
Heuristic: the process by which attitudes, or beliefs are changed by appeals to
habit or emotion
## Cognitive Dissonance
An unpleasant state that arises when a person recognizes the inconsistency of ones
actions, attitudes or beliefs
    - change to alleviate anxiety
    - inconsistencies can be justified
## Stereotypes and aspects and examples of them (subtyping, overestimate and underestimate effects, inaccurate, overused, automatic and self-perpetuating – stereotype threat)
The process by which people draw inferences about others based on their knowledge of
the categories to which others belong
Inaccurate: overestimates rare events
Overused: underestimate within category variability and overestimate between category
variability
Automatic: unconsciously
Self-perpetuating
    - Perpetual confirmation
    - Subtyping: "Dont get me wrong...I know some very nice X people, but..."
    - Self-fulfilling prophecy
Stereotype Threat: Steele and Aronson
    - People feel threatened in situations in which they beleive that their 
    performace will identify them as examples of their groups negative stereotype
