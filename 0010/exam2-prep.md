# Memory
Def: The ability to store and retrieve information over time
Three key functions of memory:
- Encoding: the process by which we transform what we percieve, thing, or feel
into an enduring memory
- Storage: the process of maintaining information in memory over time
- Retrieval: the process of bring to mind information that has been previously 
encoding and stored
## Encoding
1. Elaborative encoding: levels of processing
Types of judgement
- Semantic judgement - deep
- Rhyme judgement - intermediate
- Visual judgement - shallow
2. Visual imagery encoding
The process of storing new information by converting it into mental pictures
Method of loci
- A classic mnemonic technique that depends heavily on visual imagery and the 
use of spatial knowledge to organize recall
3. Organization encoding: organizing words into a hierarchy
The process of categorizing information according to the relationships among 
a series of items

Brain activity during different types of encoding
Elaborative encoding semantic judgments: lower left frontal lobe
Organizational encoding: upper left frontal lobe
Elaborative encoding, visual judgments: occipital lobe
## Storage
Three major kinds of memory storage
1. Sensory memory: storage that holds sensory information for a few seconds or less
- Iconic memory: a fast-decaying store of visual information
- Echoic memory: a fast-decaying store of auditory information
2. Short-term memory / working memory: storage that holds non-sensory information for
more that a few seconds but less than a minute; can hold about 7 items
- Working memory: active maintenance of information in STM
- Rehearsal: the process of keeping information in STM by mentally repeating it
- Chunking: Combining small pieces of information into larger clusters that are more
easily help in STM
3. Long-term memory: storage that holds information for hours, days, weeks, or years;
no known capacity
## Memory consolidation
Consolidation: the process by which memories become stable in the brain
Reconsolidation: memories can become vulnerable to disruption when they are recalled,
requiring them to become consoldated again
## Retrieval cues
Encoding specificity principle: the idea that a retrieval cue can serve as an effective
reminder when it helps recreate the specific way in whcih information was initially
encoded
- State dependent retrieval: the tendency for information to be better recalled when the 
person is in the same state during encoding and retrieval
## Multiple forms of memory
Long-term memory
    - Explicit memory(with conscious recall)
        - Semantic memory(facts and general knowledge)
        - Episodic memory(personally experienced events)
    - Implicit memory(without conscious recall)
        - Procedural memory(motor and cognitive skills)
        - Priming(enhanced indentification of objects or words)
## Priming
There is reduced activity in the frontal love after priming
## Memory failures: the curve of forgetting
1. Transience: forgetting what occurs with the passage of time
- Retroactice interference: when you forget something you already learned after
learning a new thing
- Proactive interference: when you forget something you just learned because of something
you learned before it
- Example: you learn Julies name first, then Judy - retroactive interference would be
to forget Julies name, proactive interference would be to forget Judy's name
2. Absentmindedness: a lapse in attention that results in memory failure
    - Prospective memory: remembering to do things in the future
    - Attention
3. Blocking: a failure to retrieve information that is available in memory even
though you are trying to produce it(tip of the tongue phenomenon)
4. Memory misattribution: assigning a recollection or an idea to the wrong souce
    - Source memory; recall of when, where, and how information was acquired
    - False recognition: a feeling of familiarity about something has has not been
    encountered before
5. Suggestability: the tendencyt to incorporate misleading information from external
sources into personal recollections
6. Bias: the distoring influences of present knowledge, beliefs, and feelings on
recollection of previous experiences
7. PersistenceL the intrusive recollection of events that we wish we could forget
    - Often occurs after disturing or traumatic events
    - Emotional experiences better remembered than unemotional ones
    - Flashbulb memories: detailed recollections of when and where we heard about
    shocking events
    - The amygdala is invloved in emotional memory
# Learning
## Behaviorism learning
Learning: experience that result in a relatively permanent change in the state of
the learner
Two main approaches to learning:
    - Classical conditioning: a reflexive or automatic type of learning in which
    a stimulus evokes a response that was originally evoked by another stimuls
    - Operant conditioning: a voluntary response strengthened or weakened by favorable
    or unfavorable consequences
    - Other types of learning also include observational learning and learning
    outside of awareness(implicit learning)
Pavlovs experiment
    Food --> salivation
    Food paired with bell --> salivation
Generalization: the conditioned response is observed even though the conditioned 
stimulus is slighly different
Discrimination: the capacity to distinguich between similar but distinc stimuli
Thorndikes puzzle box
    - Operant conditioning: a type of learning in which the consequences of an 
    organism's behavior determine whether it will be repeated in the future
B.F. Skinner - skinner box
    - Shaping: learning that results from the reinforcement of successive steps
    to a final desired behavior
Types of rewards
- Reinforcement: increases the frequency of desired behavior
- Punishment: decreases the frequency of undesired behavior
Overjustification effect: circumstances when external rewards can undermine the 
intrinsic satisfaction of performing a behavior
## Classical vs operant conditioning
Classical conditioning is centered on involuntary automatic behaviors
    - Paring of two things: bel and salivating
    - Autonomic nervous system
Operant conditioning is focused on voluntary behaviors
    - Motivation for future behaviors
    - Voluntary motor system
## Observational learning: social learning theory
Albert Bandura
Social influnce on learning - observation and imitation instead of reinforcement
Social cognitive theory
    - Observational
    - (vicarious) learning
    - Modeling
    - Imitation
## Implicit learning
Habituation: a general process in which repeated or prolonged exposure to a stimulus
results in a gradual reduction in response
    - Occurs in the simplest organisms or humans without mechanisms for explit learning
    - Changes may not last long
# Language and thought
## Language and communication: from rules to meaning
Language: a system for communicating with others using signals that are combined
according to rules of grammar and to convey meaning
Grammer: a set of rules that specify how the units of language can be combined to
produce meaningful messages.
What is so special about human language?
    - Semanticity and arbitrariness of units
    - Displacement of time and space
    - Discreteness and productivity
## Morphemes - the smallest unit of linguistic meaning
Every word in every language is composed of one or more morphemes
One morpheme
    - boy
    - desire, lady, water
    - crocodile
    - salamander
Two morphems
    - boy+ish
    - desire+able
Three morphemes
    - boy+ish+ness
    - desire+able+ity
## Syntactical rules
Surface structure and deep structure
Sentence
    - Noun phrase
        - Determiner
            - The
        - Noun
            - Dog
    - Verb phrase
        - Verb
            - Eats
        - Noun phrase
            - adjective
                -juicy
            - noun
                - bone
        - determiner
                - a
## Language development
Three characteristics of language development
    - Children learn language at an astonishing rate
    - Children make few errors while learning to speak
    - Childresn passive mastery develops faster than their active mastery
Infants can distinguish between all human phonemes, althoughh this ability dissipates
by 6 months of age
All infants go though the same babbling sequence
## Silent babbling
Babies who are exposed to the sign language engage in "silent babbling"
A subset of their hand movements differ from those of infants exposed to spoken 
language in that their slower rhythm corresponds to the rhythmic pattern of adult sign
## Grammatical rules
Overgeneralization - speech erros in which children treat irregular forms of words as
if they were regular
Examples:
    - We buyed it
    - I just about felled
    - Feets
## 3 theories of language development
1. Behaviorist explanations state that language is learned through operant conditioning
and imitation
2. Nativist explanations argue that language is innate; more evidence converges on
this theory
    - Nativist theory: language development is best explained as an innate biological
    capacity
    - Language acquisition device: a collection of processes that facilitate language
    learning
    - Genetic dysphasia: a syndrome characterized by an inability to learn the 
    grammatical structure of language despite having otherwise normal intelligence
3. Interactionist explanations argue that social interactions play a crucial role in
language
    - Social experience interacts with innate, biological language abilites
The relation betwen language and thought -- three possibilites
    - Thought depends in various ways on language
    - Language depends in various ways on thought
    - they are two independent systems
## Prototype theory and exemplar theory
Prototypes
    -Left hemisphere and visual cortex(holistic)
Exemplars
    - Right hemisphere, prefrontal cortex and basil ganglia(analysis and decisions
## Problem solving
There exist two major kinds of problems:
    - ill-defined problems(do not have clear goals)
    - well-defined problems(clearly specified goals and solution paths)
Means-end analysis: a process of searching for the means or steps to reduce the 
differences between the current situation and the desired goal
Analogical problem solving: solving a problem by finding a similar problem with a
know solution and applying that solution to the current problem.
## Dunkers radiation problem
Malignant tumar with x-ray to destroy it
X-ray of proper intensity to destroy tumar with also destroy healthy tumor
X-ray of intensity to not destroy healthy tissue will not destroy tumor
## Framing effect
When people give different answers to the same problem depending on how the problem
is phrased
    - Positive framing: A medicine has a 70% effectiveness rate
    - Negative framing: A medicine has a 30% failure rate
Framing effects can limit insightful problem solving
    - Functional fixedness: the tendency to preceive the functions of objects as fixed
