# 1: Study overview and Hypothesis
For this study I want to look at the impact of meditation for college students
and how it impacts their focus and performace in school.
Hypothesis: Students who practice meditation will shows better concentration during
class and work, and thus will do have a better performace in school.
# 2: Participants
The sample for this study will be college students, split equally into the experimental
group(those practicing mediation) and a control group(those not practicing meditation).
# 3: Independed and dependent variables
Independent variable: Practing mediation vs not
Dependent variable: Academic success and reports on focus from students.
# 4: Control condition and experimental condition
Experimental condition: Students will practice meditation every day.
Control condition: Students will go about their studies normally, not practicing 
meditation
IV: Manipulated by randomly assigning participants to either group.
# 5: Evaluation
In order to evaluate the outcome of the study, all participants will submit weekly
self reports on how their focus is, and submit their grades to evaluate academic 
success. Both groups, control and experimental, submit these things weekly to be
analysed for differences in the groups.
# 6: Significance
This study is important because many college students feel a lot of stress and the
inability to focus on their school work and lectures. Meditation has been shown to
have a lot of benifits in these areas, yet it not practiced by many especially during
college.
