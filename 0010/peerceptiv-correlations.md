## Variables
1. Outside temperature
2. Ice cream sales at an ice cream shop 

## Measuring the Variables
1. Outside temperature can be measured with a thermometer 
2. Ice cream sales can be measured by tracking an ice cream shops sales 

## Objective vs Subjective
1. Measuring outside temperature is objective because using a thermometer gives
an exact and consistent measurement.
2. Measuring ice cream sales is also objective, again giving an exact and
consistent measurement.

## Positive vs Negative Correlation
I think that these two variables would have a positive correlation because if the
outside temperature goes up, I think ice cream sales will usually also go up. If
outside temperature goes down, I think ice cream sales will usually go down.

## Third Variable
A third variable that might impact this correlation could be the day of week,
for example if it is a school or work day, people might be less likely to buy 
ice cream.
