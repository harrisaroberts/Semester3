Nativism: The philisophical view that certain kinds of knowledge are innate or inborn
- So you are born with innate 'talent' for certain things
Philisophical empiricism: The philisophical view that all knowledge is acquired
through experience.
- Instead of being born with innate 'talent' you aquire this though any experiences you have
Instead of just one of these being true it is most likely a mixture of both.

Fuctionalism: Study how mental abilities allow people to adapt to their enviroments.
- William James kinda the first guy to do some stuff, scientific approach to
studying psychology(he was not very good at the science though).
Structuralism: Analyze the mind by breaking it down into basic components.
- Willhelp Wundt 'father of psychology', first psychology laboratory.

Scientific method: Principlies about the relationship between ideas and evidence.
Theory: Hypothetical explantion of natural phenomena.
Hypothesis: Prediction made by a theory.
Empirical method: Rules or techniques for observation
- Must use  methods of observations and explanation
- Objective and subjective
- Opinions are always going to be subjective, but an actual test of something will give 
objective results.
Operational definition: Specfic, precise procedure where a variable is defined
and measured.
- Define and detect
- Can define things many different ways, important to pick an exact definition
- Might define things in an objective or subjective
Measure: Device that can detect the condition to which an operational definition
refers.
- Validity is how closely related a measurment and a property are related
- Reliablity is how often a measure produces the same measurment, consistency
- Power is how accurate you can be with your data kinda, like if you have a small
sample size in a study that would be an example of not enough power.
Demanded characteristics: An observational setting causing people to act differently,
or act as they think they should.
Naturalistic observation: Hiding the fact that subjects are being observed in a study,
unobtrusively observing people in their natural enviroments.
Observer bias: Expectations can influence the observations being made, influencing
perceptions of reality.
- Double-blind is an observations where the true purpose is hidden from both
the observer and the person being observed.
Correlation: Two variables are correlated when variations in one variable are
synchronuzed with variations in the other variable. Correlation could be strong
or weak.
- Positive correlations is where both varaible increase or decrease together.
- Negative correlation is where one variable might increase while the other 
decreases.
Causation: A correlation observed in the world around us.
- Third variable problem is the fact that a relationship between two variables
cannot be inferred from a correlation between them, this is because of the 
possibility of a third variable correlation.
