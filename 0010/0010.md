Nativism: The philisophical view that certain kinds of knowledge are innate or inborn
- So you are born with innate 'talent' for certain things
Philisophical empiricism: The philisophical view that all knowledge is acquired
through experience.
- Instead of being born with innate 'talent' you aquire this though any experiences you have
Instead of just one of these being true it is most likely a mixture of both.

Fuctionalism: Study how mental abilities allow people to adapt to their enviroments.
- William James kinda the first guy to do some stuff, scientific approach to
studying psychology(he was not very good at the science though).
Structuralism: Analyze the mind by breaking it down into basic components.
- Willhelp Wundt 'father of psychology', first psychology laboratory.

Scientific method: Principlies about the relationship between ideas and evidence.
Theory: Hypothetical explantion of natural phenomena.
Hypothesis: Prediction made by a theory.
Empirical method: Rules or techniques for observation
- Must use  methods of observations and explanation
- Objective and subjective
- Opinions are always going to be subjective, but an actual test of something will give 
objective results.
Operational definition: Specfic, precise procedure where a variable is defined
and measured.
- Define and detect
- Can define things many different ways, important to pick an exact definition
- Might define things in an objective or subjective
Measure: Device that can detect the condition to which an operational definition
refers.
- Validity is how closely related a measurment and a property are related
- Reliablity is how often a measure produces the same measurment, consistency
- Power is how accurate you can be with your data kinda, like if you have a small
sample size in a study that would be an example of not enough power.
Demanded characteristics: An observational setting causing people to act differently,
or act as they think they should.
Naturalistic observation: Hiding the fact that subjects are being observed in a study,
unobtrusively observing people in their natural enviroments.
Observer bias: Expectations can influence the observations being made, influencing
perceptions of reality.
- Double-blind is an observations where the true purpose is hidden from both
the observer and the person being observed.
Correlation: Two variables are correlated when variations in one variable are
synchronuzed with variations in the other variable. Correlation could be strong
or weak.
- Positive correlations is where both varaible increase or decrease together.
- Negative correlation is where one variable might increase while the other 
decreases.
Causation: A correlation observed in the world around us.
- Third variable problem is the fact that a relationship between two variables
cannot be inferred from a correlation between them, this is because of the 
possibility of a third variable correlation.

Neurons: Cells in the nervous system that communicate with one another to preform 
information-processing tasks.
Santiago Ramon y Cajal (1852-1934d): First stained neurons in the brain

Types of neurons:
- Sensory neurons: Gather information from external world, sending either directly
to your brain, or through your spinal cord. Like things you hear, see, smell, touch
- Motor neurons interpret what they get from the sensory neurons, carry signals 
from the spinal cord to the muscels to produce movement.
- Interneurons: Connect sensory neurons, motor neurons and other interneurons.
- Mirror neurons: Neurons that fire both when the animal is performing the action
and when it observes another animal performing the action. So not necessarily 
doing anything, but they will fire when we see someone else performing an action.
Mirror neurons can also send signals to the emotional part of our brains, helping
things like empathy, and learning. Mirror neurons are only helpful in a social 
context.

The resting potential: In the resting state k- molecules flow freely across the cell
membrane, but Na- molecules are kept out, creating a difference in electric charge
between the inside and outside of a neuron's cell membrane. THe inside of the neuron
has a charge of about -70 millivolts relative to the outside, whcih is the potential
energy that will be used to generate the action potential.
The action potential: Electric simulation of the neuron shts down the K- 
channels and opens the NA- channels, allowing NA- to rush in and increase the 
positive charge inside the axon relative to the outside, triggering the action 
potential.
The imbalance in ions from the action potential is reversed by an active chemical
"pump" in the cell membrane that mives Na- outside the axon and moves K- inside
the axon. The neuron can now generate another action potential.

Types of functions of neurotransmitters:
- Acetylocholine (ACh): involved in a number of functions including voluntary
motor control. Found in a lot of organs, associated with attention, learning, sleeping
ect. Also been associated with alzheimers.
- Dopamine (DA): Regulates motor behavior, motivation, pleasure, and emotional 
arousal. Associated with parkinsons.
- Glutamate: major excitatory neurotrasmitter involved in information throughout
the brain.
- Gaba: major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain.
Norepinephrine (NE): Influences mood and arousal. Associated with things like 
anxiety and depression.
- Serotonin (5-HT): Involved in the regulation of sleep and wakefulness, eating and
aggressive behavior, also highly associated with anxiety and depression. New 
research challenges the link between depression and serotonin. Males usually
have more serotonin than women. 
- Endorphins: chemicals that act within the pain pathways and emotion centers of
the brain. Like a runners high, kind of like our bodies natural morphine.
