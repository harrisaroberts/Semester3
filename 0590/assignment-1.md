The topic that I will be writing about for this paper is the issue with right to
repair. I think that this is a very interesting topic, that is incressingly relevant
today with companies like Apple, who make repairing and upgrading their technology
very hard. In the past few years, laws have been passed in support of right to repair
and Apple even ended up backing these laws.
