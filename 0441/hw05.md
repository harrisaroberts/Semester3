## Find two sets A and B such that $A\in B$ and $A\subseteq B$.
$A = \{1,2\}, B = \{1,2,\{1,2\}\}$
# Problem 3: Sec 2.1, #28 (12 points)
## Show that if $A\subseteq C$ and $B\subseteq D$, then $A\times B\subseteq C\cdot D$
1. Let $(x,y)\in A\times B$, so $x\in A, y\in B$
2. Since $A\subseteq C$ and $B\subseteq D, x\in C$ and $y\in D$
3. Therefore, $(x,y)\in C\times D$
4. Finally, $A\times B\subseteq C\cdot D$
# Problem 4: Sec 2.1, #50 (12 points)
## This exercise present Russell's paradox. Let S be the set that contains a set x if the set x does not belong to itself, so that $S=\{x|x\notin x\}$.
### a) Show the assumption that S is a member of S leads to a contradiction.
1. If S is a member of S, then S satisfies $S=\{x|x\notin x\}$.
2. However, by definition of S, it contains sets that do not belong to themselves.
3. This leads to a contradiction, if S belongs to itself then, by definition, it should not belong to itself.
### b) Show the assumption that S is not a member of S leads to a contradiction.
1. If S is not a member of itself, then S does not satisfy $S=\{x|x\notin x\}$
2. If S does not contain itself, it should satisfy the condition of containing sets that do not belong to itself.
3. So if S does not contain itself, by definition, it should contain itself, leading to a contradiction.
# Problem 5: Sec 2.2, #81 (12 points)
## Prove the idempotent laws in Table 1 by showing that
### a) $A\cup A=A$
1. Let $x\in A\cup A$, by definition of union, x is in A or in A. Since A is one set, x must be in A.
2. So, $A\cup A\subseteq A$
3. Now let $y\in A$, by definition of union, y is in A or in A.
4. Thus, $A\subseteq A\cup A$
5. Since $A\cup A\subseteq A$ and $A\subseteq A\cup A$, we conclude that $A\cup A=A$
### b) $A\cap A=A$
1. Let $x\in A\cap A$, by definition of intersection, x is in both A and A. Since its the same set, x is in A.
2. So, $A\cap A\subseteq A$.
3. Now, let $y\in A$. Since y is in A, and $A\cap A$ contains only elemnts that are in both A and A, y is also in $A\cap A$
4. So, $A\subseteq A\cap A$
5. Since $A\cap A\subseteq A$ and $A\subseteq A\cap A$, we can conclude $A\cap A=A$
# Problem 6: Sec 2.2, #16 (25 points)
## Let A and b be sets. Show that
### a) $(A\cap B)\subseteq A$
1. Let x be an arbitrary element in $A\cap B$, by definition of intersection x is in both A and B
2. So, any element x in $A\cap B$ must also be in A
3. Therefore, $(A\cap B)\subseteq A$
### b) $A\subseteq (A\cup B)$
1. Let x be an arbitrary element in A, by definition of union, x is in A or B.
2. Since x is in A, x must be in $A\cup B$
3. Therfore, $A\subseteq(A\cup B)$
### c) $A - B\subseteq A$
1. Let x be an arbitrary element in $A-B$, by definition of set difference, x is in A but not in B.
2. So any element x in $A-B$, x must be in A
3. Therefore, $A-B\subseteq A$
### d) $A\cap(B-A)=\emptyset$
1. $B-A$ consists of elements in B and not in A by set difference definition
2. Thus, no element can be in both $A$ and $B-A$
3. Therefore, $A\cap(B-A)=\emptyset$
### e) A\cup(B-A)=A\cup B$
1. Let x be an arbitrary element in $A\cup(B-A)$
2. If $x\in A$, then $x\in A\cup B$ since $A\subseteq A\cup B$
3. If x\in(B-A)$, then $x\in A\cup B$ because $x\in B$ and $x\notin A$ by set difference definition
4. Since every element in $A\cup(B-A)$ is also in $A\cup B$, then $A\cup(B-A)\subseteq A\cup B$
5. Now, let y be an arbitrary element in $A\cup B$
6. If $y\in A$, then $y\in A\cup(B-A)$
7. If $y\in B$, and $y\notin A$, then $y\in B-A$, so $y\in A\cup(B-A)$
8. Since every element in $A\cup B$ is in $A\cup(B-A)$, then $A\cup B\subseteq A\cup(B-A)$
9. Thus, as $A\cup(B-A)\subseteq A\cup B$ and $A\cup B\subseteq A\cup(B-A)$, we can conclude that $A\cup(B-A)=A\cup B$
# Problem 7: Sec 2.2, #22 (14 points)
## Show that if A and B are sets with $A\subseteq B$, then
### a) $A\cup B=B$
1. Let x be an arbitrary element in $A\cup B$, by definition of union x is in A or B
2. Since every element in A is also in B, if x is in A it must also be in B
3. Therefore, every element in $A\cup B$ is in B, meaning that $A\cup B\subseteq B$
4. Now consider $y\in B$, therefore $y\in(A\cup B$ by definition of of union
5. Thus, $B\subseteq A\cup B$
6. Since $A\cup B\subseteq B$ and $B\subseteq A\cup B$, we can conclude that $A\cup B=A$
### b) $A\cap B=A$
1. Let x be an arbitrary element in $A\cap B$, by definition of intersection, x is in both A and B
2. Since every element in $A\cap B$ is in A, $A\cap B\subseteq A$
3. Since every element in A is also in B, if x is in A, it must also be in B
4. Now consider $y\in A$, y is in both A and B since every element in A is also in B, if y is in A, it must also be in B
5. Thus, $A\subseteq A\cap B$
6. Since $A\cap B\subseteq A$ and $A\subseteq A\cap B$, we can conclude that $A\cap B=A$
# Problem 8: Sec 2.2, #34 (12 points)
## Let A, B, and C be sets. use the identity $A-B=A\cap B'$, which holds for any sets A and B, and the identities from Table 1 to show that $(A-B)\cap(B-C)\cap(A-C)=\emptyset$
1. $A-B=A\cap B'$ (Given)
2. $B-C=B\cap C'$ (1)
3. $A-C=A\cap C'$ (1)
4. $(A\cap B')\cap(B\cap C')\cap(A\cap C')$ (1,2,3)
5. $(A\cap B')\cap(B\cap C')\cap(A\cap C')=(A\cap A')\cap(B\cap B')\cap(C\cap C')$ (Distributive law of intersection)
6. $(A\cap A')\cap(B\cap B')\cap(C\cap C') = \emptyset\cap\emptyset\cap\emptyset$ (Complement Law)
7. $\emptyset\cap\emptyset\cap\emptyset = \emptyset$ (Idempotent laws)
