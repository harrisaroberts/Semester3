Given a collection of known truths, logic allows us to deduce new truths.

Propositional logic: A proposition is a precise statement that is either true
or false, but not both. 
- Not every statement is a proposition, some are more subjective, not necessarily 
true or false.

Logical connectives:
- $\neg$ (not)
- $\land$ (and)
- $\lor$ (or)
- $\oplus$ (xor)
- $\rightarrow$ (implication)
- $\leftrightarrow$ (biconditional)

Precedence levels(not PEMDAS, but NCDIB...maybe NAOIB):
1. Negations
2. Conjunction
3. Disjunction
4. Implication
5. Biconditional

Propositional equivalences: preliminaries
- A toutology is a compound proposition that is always true, regardless of the 
truth values of the propositions occuring within it
- A contradiction is a compound proposition that is always false, regardless of
the truth values of the popositions occuring within it
- A contingency is compound proposition whose truth value is dependent on the
propositons occuring within it.

Propositional logic has no way of reasoning about instances of general statements.

Predicate logic allows us to use propositional functions during our logical reasoning.
$P(x)\equiv x^3 > 0$
$x$ - variable
$x^3>0$ - predicate

Quantifiers allow us to make general statements that turn propostional functions
into propositions
- Quantifiers require us to define a universe of discourse (also called a domain)
in order for the quantification to make sense.(e.g. "Many like chocolate" doesnt
make sense)

$\forall$ is a universal quantification, allowing us to make statements about
the entire universe of discourse
$\exists$ is a existential quantifier, allowing us to make statements about 
some objects

The universal and existential quantifiers have the highest precedence of all
logical operators.
- Use parentheses to disambiguate a quantifiers scope

Two statements involving predicates and quantifers are logically equivalent iff
they take on the same truth value regardless of which predicates are substituted
into these statements and which domains of discourse are used.

There is also DeMorgan's law for quantifiers
- $\neg(\forall{x} P(x))\equiv \exists{x}(\neg{P(x))$
- $\neg{(exists{x}P(x))}\equiv \forall{x}(\neg{P(x)}$

To translate English sentences into logical expressions:
1. Rewrite the sentence to make it easier to translate
2. Determine the appropriate quantifiers to use
3. Look for words that indicate logical operators
4. Formalize sentece fragments
5. Put it all together

### 2024-09-16
Many times, we need the ability to nest one quantifier within the scope of another
quantifier.
- Read nested quantifers from left to right

Translate mathematic expressions to English statements
1. Rewrite statement to make quantification and logical operators more explicit
2. Determine the order in which qantifiers should appear
3. Generate logical expression
