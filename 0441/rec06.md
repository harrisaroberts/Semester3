# Reflecting on the CS 0441 midterm that you took on Tue, Oct 16, was the exam more/less difficult than you were expecting, or about the same?
The exam was a little harder than I expected, I felt that the practice exam had much easier problems on it than the exam actually did, and the main issue I had was time to complete them all.
# What part of the exam did you feel least prepared for? What do you think caused this?
I think I was least prepared for the informal proofs section, really just because I didnt have that many problems to practice on.
# What part of the exam did you feel most prepared for? What study techniques (etc.) are working that helped you get there
I felt most prepared for the logical equivalence problems, I was able to find many more practice problems for this section.
